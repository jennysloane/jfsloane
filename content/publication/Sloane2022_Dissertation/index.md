abstract: From a child interrupting a conversation between her parents to ask “What’s for dinner?” to a nurse interrupting a physician in the middle of a complex procedure with an urgent message, interruptions are an inevitable part of our daily lives no matter who we are, where we live, or what we do. Interruptions can have a variety of affects on people’s performance and behavior. While interruptions may sometimes facilitate performance, often interruptions have negative consequences. For example, interruptions may result in people making more errors or forgetting to complete a prior task altogether. This thesis examines existing strategies to help mitigate interruption costs and explores the effects of interruptions within different decision environments.
