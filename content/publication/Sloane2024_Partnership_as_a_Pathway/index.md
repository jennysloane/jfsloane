abstract: Background - Learning health system (LHS) approaches could potentially help health care organizations (HCOs) identify and address diagnostic errors. However, few such programs exist, and their implementation is poorly understood. Methods - The authors conducted a qualitative evaluation of the Safer Dx Learning Lab, a partnership between a health system and a research team, to identify and learn from diagnostic errors and improve diagnostic safety at an organizational level. The research team conducted virtual interviews to solicit participant feedback regarding experiences with the lab, focusing specifically on implementation and sustainment issues. Results - Interviews of 25 members associated with the lab identified the following successes - learning and professional growth, improved workflow related to streamlining the process of reporting error cases, and a psychologically safe culture for identifying and reporting diagnostic errors. However, multiple barriers also emerged - competing priorities between clinical responsibilities and research, time-management issues related to a lack of protected time, and inadequate guidance to disseminate findings. Lessons learned included understanding the importance of obtaining buy-in from leadership and interested stakeholders, creating a psychologically safe environment for reporting cases, and the need for more protected time for clinicians to review and learn from cases. Conclusion - Findings suggest that a learning health systems approach using partnerships between researchers and a health system affected organizational culture by prioritizing learning from diagnostic errors and encouraging clinicians to be more open to reporting. The study findings can help organizations overcome barriers to engage clinicians and inform future implementation and sustainment of similar initiatives.
