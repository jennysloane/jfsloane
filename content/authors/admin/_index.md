I'm a quantitative methodologist at the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness and Safety (IQuESt), which is associated with the Houston VA and Baylor College of Medicine. I am currently the lead quantitative methodologist on the Houston Evidence-based Rapid Measurement and Evaluation (HERMES), an internationally recognized, mixed methods program focused on improving Veteran health and safety. I have 12 years of experience as a cognitive psychologist and programmer and 3 years of experience in Health Services Research. 

I received my BA in psychology from the University of Maryland in 2014, my Masters of Science in experimental psychology from Syracuse University in 2017, my PhD in cognitive psychology from University of New South Wales in 2022, and I completed a 2-year Health Services Research postdoctoral fellowship at IQuESt in 2024.
