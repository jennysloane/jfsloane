abstract: To accelerate progress in diagnostic safety science and improvement activities, we used two methods to identify major themes related to the current state of diagnostic safety and highlight key gaps in knowledge. The first was a rapid narrative review methodology to evaluate multiple resources in the literature and the second included interviews with experts. Findings have several implications for future resource investments to reduce harm from diagnostic errors.
